The study presents an innovative automated career guidance model based on analysis of users' digital footprints in social networks, employing state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to predict professional aptitudes according to the RIASEC (Holland) framework. The research utilizes embeddings for vector representation of user interests and applies dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, autoencoder). High prediction accuracy was achieved: 99.27% for cases with at least one match in the professional triad and 74.45% for cases with two or more matches. A novel evaluation metric was developed based on alignment of dominant professional triads. The CatBoost and XGBoost models demonstrated the best performance. The practical significance of the study lies in its potential to automate career guidance processes through digital footprint analysis without requiring questionnaires, offering promising prospects for integrating this solution into career counseling systems.
